### work in progress

[Example](http://sketch.evanyou.me/matrix/)

A mini CSS 3D engine. Similar to Three.js CSS3D Renderer, but less intrusive and much lighter-weight (and of course less powerful).

Roughly tested on Chrome/Safari on Mac OS X Lion and iPhone 5 - the max amount of elements for 60fps performance seems to be around 200 ~ 300 depending on hardware and complexity of transforms. It does run in Firefox but as of now Firefox doesn't use GPU for CSS 3D transforms, so don't expect it to work well.
